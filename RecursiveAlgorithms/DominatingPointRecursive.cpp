/*  
    Problem statement:
    Consider a set S of n points on a two-dimensional plane. Each point p_i
    is given by a pair of co-ordinates x_i , y_i . A point p_i is said to dominate
    another point p_j iff x_i > x_j and y_i > y_j . That is, p_i â€™s values are larger
    than those of p_j in both dimensions. The rank of a point p_i , denoted
    by R(p_i ), is defined as the number of points in S that are dominated
    by p_i . 
    Assume that S is represented by two arrays X[1..n]
    and Y [1..n] such that the coordinates of p_i are given by (X[i], Y [i]).
